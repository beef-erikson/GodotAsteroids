# GodotAsteroids
Asteroids clone developed in Godot 3.1
No binaries yet as this is still in development but to use, open project in Godot and run 'main/Main.tscn' to play.
Many properties can be changed such a ship thrust, turning velocity, fire speed and so on.

Upcoming features will be sound, a shield for the ship, UFO damage (currently they do not as I want the shield in first), particle effects, and some control tweaks.
